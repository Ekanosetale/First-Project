This analysis was carried out to evaluate based on the companyâ€™s performance in the previous year, which specific category, quarters, Months, Products, and states deserves more attention. This will serve as pointers to perform better and make informed decisions in the coming year.
# Questions I want to answer
To achieve the objective stated above, I raise the following question to serve as a guide:
1.	What are the top-performing products in terms of sales and profit? 
2.	Which category showed the highest sales growth in the previous year
3.	Are there any particular regions where sales showed a noticeable increase or decrease?
4.	Which cities or states have been consistently driving high sales figures? 
5.	 Are there any specific quarters in the previous year that had significant fluctuations in sales?
6.	Which months in the previous year had the highest sales, and what factors contributed to those successful months?
