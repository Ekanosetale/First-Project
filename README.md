# About the analysis
This analysis was carried out to evaluate based on the companyâ€™s performance in the previous year, which specific category, quarters, Months, Products, and states deserves more attention. This will serve as pointers to perform better and make informed decisions in the coming year.

1.	What are the top-performing products in terms of sales and profit? 
2.	Which category showed the highest sales growth in the previous year
3.	Are there any particular regions where sales showed a noticeable increase or decrease?
4.	Which cities or states have been consistently driving high sales figures? 
5.	 Are there any specific quarters in the previous year that had significant fluctuations in sales?

# Data Manipulation
 The calculation for some key indicative figures such as **Total Profit, Total Number of Sales, Total Revenue Generated in the year, Total discount Given, and Quantities Sold** was done.  
The **COUNT FUNCTION** was used to calculate the Total Number of Sales, while SUM FUNCTION was used to calculate Total Profit, Total Revenue Generated in the year, Total discount Given, and Quantities Sold.
# Data Analysis
This analysis aims to determine top-performing products in terms of sales and whether the company should focus on promoting these products more in the new business year. To achieve this objective, I plotted a **bar chart** of the various product against their total sales that year and inserted a **slicer** to indicate the products according to their categories. The chart showed that in the **Office Supply category**, **Blinder** recorded the **highest** of **1523** which is the most sold good across **all categories**. While **Supplies** were the least-performing product in the category. In the **Technology category**, the **phone** was the most sold good while the **copier** was the least of all the company's products. For the **Furniture category**, **Furnishing** was the most sold good while Bookcases was the least sold good.
